# Instruments
This is light project. For CSS I use SASS, for HTML I use PUG, for rendering locally I use lite-server.

# How to run
In order to install packeages, type the following:
```
npm install
```
For correct work of pug locally, you need to install pug-cli globally
```
npm install pug-cli
```
In order to run it, type the following:
```
npm run build
```
